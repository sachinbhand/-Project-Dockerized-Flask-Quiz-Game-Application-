🚀 Project: Dockerized Flask Quiz Game Application 🐳🐍

Excited to share a hands-on DevOps & Backend project where I built and deployed a Flask-based Quiz Game application using Docker on a Linux environment.

🔹 Project Flow:
 1️⃣ Developed a custom Python Flask web application for a quiz system
 2️⃣ Designed HTML views using Flask templates
 3️⃣ Created a custom Dockerfile using a lightweight Python base image
 4️⃣ Built a Docker image and deployed the application inside a container 🐳
 5️⃣ Configured port mapping to access the application externally 🌐
 6️⃣ Debugged and resolved container runtime issues (CMD errors, container exits)
 7️⃣ Successfully ran the application as a Dockerized service

📚 Key Takeaways:
 ✅ Practical understanding of Flask application structure
 ✅ Hands-on experience with Docker images, containers, and Dockerfile creation
 ✅ Clear understanding of build-time vs runtime errors in Docker
 ✅ Improved skills in container debugging and application deployment
 ✅ Strong foundation in DevOps and cloud-ready application design
